Automatic and efficient methods for semantic labelling of airborne urban point cloud data with multiple classes still remains a challenge. We propose a novel 3D object-based classification framework for labelling urban lidar point cloud using a computer vision technique, supervoxels. The supervoxel approach is promising for representing dense lidar point cloud in a compact manner for 3D segmentation and for improving the computational efficiency. Initially, supervoxels are generated by over-segmenting the coloured point cloud using the voxel-based cloud connectivity algorithm in the geometric space. The local connectivity established between supervoxels has been used to produce meaningful and realistic objects (segments). The segments are classified by different machine learning techniques based on several spectral and geometric features extracted from the segments. All the points within a labelled segment are assigned the same segment label. Furthermore, the effect of different feature vectors and varying point density on the classification accuracy has been studied. Results indicate an accurate labelling of points in realistic 3D space conforming to the boundaries of objects. An overall classification accuracy of  is achieved by the proposed method. The labelled 3D points can be used directly for the reconstruction of buildings and other man-made objects.

The potential of retrieving meaningful spectral material identifications in the presence of reflectance of spectra of various material types and with various similarity metrics has been assessed in this study. Test reflectance spectra of various vegetation, minerals, soils and urban material types are identified by searching through the composite reflectance spectral library obtained by combining various institutional reflectance spectral libraries. The accuracy of material identifications under various conditions: (i) in the presence of identical, similar and dissimilar spectra; (ii) in the presence of only identical and dissimilar spectra; and (iii) in the presence of only dissimilar spectra has been assessed with several similarity metrics. Results indicate the possibility of obtaining 100% accurate material identifications by library search if the spectral library contains identical spectra. However, the presence of a large number of similar spectra, despite the presence of identical spectra, is found to increase false positives, thereby reducing the accuracy of retrievals to 82% at best. Further, the accuracy of material identifications in the presence of similar spectra is similarity metric-dependent and varied from about 52% (obtained from Binary Encoding) to 82% (obtained from Normalized Spectral Similarity Score). Overall, results support the possibility of using independent reflectance spectral libraries for material identification while calling for robust spectral similarity metrics.","tags":[],"title":"Spectral identification of materials by reflectance spectral library search","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ramiya A.M.","Senthil S."],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1403760265,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1403760265,"objectID":"6e32c9fc6ac35434b1484cd0ea8eab9a","permalink":"https://ramiya.github.io/publication/c12/","publishdate":"2019-06-26T10:54:25+05:30","relpermalink":"/publication/c12/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Wasteland Development using Remote Sensing and GIS","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ramiya","Anandakumar M.","Rama Rao Nidamanuri","and Ramakrishnan Krishnan"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1403697070,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1403697070,"objectID":"080bcd6466322abbd60f62450f3961e0","permalink":"https://ramiya.github.io/publication/c4/","publishdate":"2019-06-25T17:21:10+05:30","relpermalink":"/publication/c4/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Comparative Analysis of 3D segmentation algorithms for Building detection from LiDAR point cloud data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anandakumar M Ramiya","Rama Rao Nidamanuri","Ramakrishnan Krishnan"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1390644853,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1390644853,"objectID":"f41c8a424503aab835ae3fa855d96c1d","permalink":"https://ramiya.github.io/publication/j8/","publishdate":"2019-06-25T15:44:13+05:30","relpermalink":"/publication/j8/","section":"publication","summary":"Three dimensional urban reconstruction is gaining popularity with the paradigm shift from 2D maps to 3D maps. LiDAR remote sensing is emerging as the main source of 3D spatial data because of its very dense and discrete point cloud. The enormous amount of data collected over natural terrain calls for automatic methods for labelling the point cloud. Semantically labelling the urban point cloud into various features is essential for urban planning and development. In this study,we propose a new object oriented methodology for semantic labelling of urban point cloud data. In addition to the geometrical information from LiDAR, we have used the spectral information for labelling of the point cloud. The coloured point cloud was segmented using colour based region growing algorithm to produce 3D segments. Spectral and geometrical features were extracted from the segments created. The extracted features were classified using different classifier system into five urban classes. The proposed methodology has been tested on LiDAR captured over urban datasets .The results indicate the potential of object based classification for automated 3D point cloud labelling.","tags":[],"title":"Semantic labelling of urban point cloud data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ramiya AM"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1340625084,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1340625084,"objectID":"d99aa4daf2549de6660bcba5e70e73f8","permalink":"https://ramiya.github.io/publication/c8/","publishdate":"2019-06-25T17:21:24+05:30","relpermalink":"/publication/c8/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Effect of Atmosphere on Object based Image Analysis (OBIA)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nidamanuri R.R.","and Ramiya","A.M."],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1309002690,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1309002690,"objectID":"06c9dca718f942977412edeec17b91dc","permalink":"https://ramiya.github.io/publication/c9/","publishdate":"2019-06-25T17:21:30+05:30","relpermalink":"/publication/c9/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Estimation of tropical forest biophysical parameters using near UV and NIR reflectance from GOSAT TANSO  CAI sensor","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ramiya A.M.","Milton E.
